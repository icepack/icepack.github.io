# Introduction

**Welcome to the homepage for *icepack*!**
Icepack is a Python library for solving the equations of motion of glacier flow.
Our goal is to lower the barrier to entry to using flow models if you're not an expert in numerical simulation, and to produce a set of tools that will be useful to you if you are.

Some features that we're especially proud of include:
* We have solvers for several flow models, from the simplest to very complex
* All the stress balance models are customizable -- changing the friction law is a few lines of code.

For examples of what icepack is capable of, have a look at the tutorials.
