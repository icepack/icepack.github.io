# Introduction

**Welcome to the homepage for *icepack*!**
Icepack is a Python library for solving the equations of motion of glacier flow.
Our goal is to lower the barrier to entry to using flow models if you're not an expert in numerical simulation, and to produce a set of tools that will be useful to you if you are.

Some features that we're especially proud of include:
* We have solvers for several flow models, from the simplest to very complex
* All the stress balance models are customizable -- changing the friction law is a few lines of code.

For examples of what icepack is capable of, have a look at the tutorials.

## Thanks

Lots of people and organizations have made this project possible.
We're grateful to the National Science Foundation, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the University of Washington eScience Institute for generous financial support.
The developers of the [Firedrake](https://firedrakeproject.org) finite element library have made a fantastic software package and provided hands-on support in debugging and optimizing icepack.
The [Juneau Icefield Research Program](https://juneauicefield.org) has provided wonderful opportunities for field work.
