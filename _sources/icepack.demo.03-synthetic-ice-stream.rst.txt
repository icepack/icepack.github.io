Synthetic ice stream
====================

In this demo, we’ll simulate the evolution of an ice stream with both
grounded and floating parts. Ice streams are substantially more
complicated than a floating ice shelf. First, there are more fields. For
floating ice shelves, we only had to consider the velocity, thickness,
and fluidity, but for ice streams there’s also the surface elevation and
bed friction. Second, the position of the grounded line – the contour
across which the glacier is thin enough to go afloat – can migrate in
time.

The diagnostic equation for an ice stream is similar to that of a
floating ice shelf, but for the addition of a term for basal friction:

.. math:: \nabla\cdot hM - C|u|^{1/m - 1}u - \rho gh\nabla s = 0,

where :math:`m` is the *sliding exponent* and :math:`C` is the *sliding
coefficient*.

The glacier state we’ll start out with is grounded throughout the entire
domain, and during the simulation it will thin out and go afloat part
way through. Accurately predicting grounding line migration is a major
problem in glacier flow modeling.

Geometry and input data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We’ll use an elongated fjord-like geometry, 12 km wide and 50 km from
the inflow boundary to the ice front. The bedrock slopes down from 200 m
above sea level at the inflow boundary to -400 m at the terminus; the
glacier becomes marine one third of the way into the domain.

.. code:: ipython3

    Lx, Ly = 50e3, 12e3
    nx, ny = 48, 32
    mesh = firedrake.RectangleMesh(nx, ny, Lx, Ly)
    
    degree = 2
    Q = firedrake.FunctionSpace(mesh, 'CG', degree)
    V = firedrake.VectorFunctionSpace(mesh, 'CG', degree)

.. code:: ipython3

    x, y = firedrake.SpatialCoordinate(mesh)
    
    b_in, b_out = 200, -400
    b = firedrake.interpolate(b_in - (b_in - b_out) * x / Lx, Q)
    
    s_in, s_out = 850, 50
    s0 = firedrake.interpolate(s_in - (s_in - s_out) * x / Lx, Q)
    
    h0 = firedrake.interpolate(s0 - b, Q)

As a sanity check, we’ll evaluate the driving stress

.. math:: \tau_D = -\rho_Igh\nabla s

at the inflow boundary of the ice stream to make sure the value isn’t
absurd.

.. code:: ipython3

    from icepack.constants import rho_ice as ρ_I, rho_water as ρ_W, gravity as g
    h_in = s_in - b_in
    δs_δx = (s_out - s_in) / Lx
    τ_D = -ρ_I * g * h_in * δs_δx
    print("{} kPa".format(1000 * τ_D))


.. parsed-literal::

    93.556008 kPa


This stress is on the moderate side for Greenland, high for Antarctica.

Next we have to come up with some rough guess for the initial velocity
of the glacier. Unlike for ice shelves, we can’t write down an exact
solution for the velocity. Our best hope is to come up with something
vaguely reasonable and tune it by trial and error until we get something
that isn’t ridiculous.

.. code:: ipython3

    u_in, u_out = 20, 2400
    velocity_x = u_in + (u_out - u_in) * (x/Lx)**2
    u0 = firedrake.interpolate(firedrake.as_vector((velocity_x, 0)), V)

.. code:: ipython3

    temp = 255.0
    A0 = icepack.rate_factor(temp)
    A = firedrake.interpolate(firedrake.Constant(A0), Q)

Now to pick a friction coefficient. We’ll use a value of the friction
that almost exactly balances the driving stress at the inflow boundary.
Where the glacier goes marine, we’ll scale the friction down acoording
to the height above flotation. This is a very rough approximation. The
point is to scale the friction down continuously as the glacier
approaches flotation. If we didn’t take care to ramp the friction down
and instead just set it to 0 where the ice is floating, we’d get a shock
to the system as the bed friction “turns off” across the grounding line.
For a realistic problem, you’d want to take greater account of how the
pressure of meltwater at the bed affects friction.

.. code:: ipython3

    from icepack.constants import weertman_sliding_law as m
    C = (0.95 - 0.05 * x/Lx) * τ_D / u_in**(1/m)
    
    p_W = ρ_W * g * firedrake.max_value(0, h0 - s0)
    p_I = ρ_I * g * h0
    ϕ = 1 - p_W / p_I

In the previous examples, we’ve initialized a model object and then used
it directly to compute velocities and thicknesses. These model objects
have sensible defaults for how the physics are parameterized. For
example, we pass in the ice fluidity coefficient :math:`A`, which has
units of strain rate :math:`\times` stress\ :math:`{}^{-3}`. We could
just as easily have used, say, the rheology coefficient
:math:`B = A^{-1/n}`, where :math:`n = 3` is the exponent in Glen’s flow
law. You can customize the physics parameterizations by passing in your
own Python functions for computing the action functional. The default in
the ``IceStream`` class is to take in a friction coefficient :math:`C`,
but we also want to include the ramping factor, which depends on the ice
thickness and surface elevation. The following function works as a
wrapper around the default parameterization, multiplying the friction
coefficient by the ramping factor.

.. code:: ipython3

    import icepack.models.friction
    def weertman_friction_with_ramp(u, h, s, C):
        p_W = ρ_W * g * firedrake.max_value(0, h - s)
        p_I = ρ_I * g * h
        ϕ = 1 - p_W / p_I
        return icepack.models.friction.bed_friction(u, C * ϕ)

Now we can create a model object that uses our new parameterization by
passing it to the constructor for the ``IceStream`` class. We’re calling
the model object ``ice_stream_weertman`` because, at the end of this
demo, we’ll compare with something quite different – the Schoof model
for basal sliding.

.. code:: ipython3

    ice_stream_weertman = icepack.models.IceStream(friction=weertman_friction_with_ramp)
    opts = {'dirichlet_ids': [1], 'side_wall_ids': [3, 4], 'tol': 1e-6}
    u0 = ice_stream_weertman.diagnostic_solve(u0=u0, h=h0, s=s0, A=A, C=C, **opts)

.. code:: ipython3

    fig, axes = icepack.plot.subplots()
    contours = icepack.plot.tricontourf(u0, 25, axes=axes)
    fig.colorbar(contours, ax=axes, fraction=0.012, pad=0.04)
    plt.show(fig)



.. image:: icepack.demo.03-synthetic-ice-stream_files/icepack.demo.03-synthetic-ice-stream_18_0.png


Below we show some plots of the basal shear stress and the mass flux.
Note how the basal shear stress gets closer to 0 near the terminus
because of how we reduced the friction.

.. code:: ipython3

    τ_b = firedrake.interpolate(-1000 * C * ϕ * sqrt(inner(u0, u0))**(1/m - 1)*u0, V)
    fig, axes = icepack.plot.subplots()
    contours = icepack.plot.tricontourf(τ_b, 25, axes=axes)
    fig.colorbar(contours, label='kPa', fraction=0.012, pad=0.04)
    plt.show(fig)



.. image:: icepack.demo.03-synthetic-ice-stream_files/icepack.demo.03-synthetic-ice-stream_20_0.png


There’s a huge mass balance anomaly near the ice front, an artifact of
our choice of initial conditions. As the simulation progresses, this
initial transient should be propagated out of the domain.

.. code:: ipython3

    f = firedrake.interpolate(-div(h0 * u0), Q)
    fig, axes = icepack.plot.subplots()
    contours = icepack.plot.tricontourf(f, 25, cmap='RdBu', axes=axes)
    fig.colorbar(contours, label='meters/year', fraction=0.012, pad=0.04)
    plt.show(fig)



.. image:: icepack.demo.03-synthetic-ice-stream_files/icepack.demo.03-synthetic-ice-stream_22_0.png


Modeling
~~~~~~~~

Now the good part – taking our initial glacier state and projecting it
forward until it reaches a steady state. We’ll use a timestep of 6
months and the simulation will run for 250 model years. This is about
enough time to propagate out the initial transients and arrive at a
state of approximate mass and momentum balance. I’ve tuned the
accumulation rate so that it roughly balances out the ice flux at the
inflow boundary and is within the range of values one might see in
southeast Greenland.

.. code:: ipython3

    num_years = 250
    timesteps_per_year = 2
    
    δt = 1.0/timesteps_per_year
    num_timesteps = num_years * timesteps_per_year
    
    a = 1.7 - 2.7 * x / Lx
    h = h0.copy(deepcopy=True)
    u = u0.copy(deepcopy=True)
    
    for k in range(num_timesteps + 1):
        h = ice_stream_weertman.prognostic_solve(δt, h0=h, a=a, u=u, h_inflow=h0)
        s = ice_stream_weertman.compute_surface(h=h, b=b)
        u = ice_stream_weertman.diagnostic_solve(u0=u, h=h, s=s, A=A, C=C, **opts)
        print('.' if k * δt % 10 == 0 else '', end='')


.. parsed-literal::

    ..........................

Now some plots of the results:

.. code:: ipython3

    fig, axes = icepack.plot.subplots()
    contours =  icepack.plot.tricontourf(h, 25, axes=axes)
    fig.colorbar(contours, label='meters', fraction=0.012, pad=0.04)
    plt.show(fig)



.. image:: icepack.demo.03-synthetic-ice-stream_files/icepack.demo.03-synthetic-ice-stream_26_0.png


.. code:: ipython3

    fig, axes = icepack.plot.subplots()
    contours = icepack.plot.tricontourf(u, 25, axes=axes)
    fig.colorbar(contours, label='meters/year', fraction=0.012, pad=0.04)
    plt.show(fig)



.. image:: icepack.demo.03-synthetic-ice-stream_files/icepack.demo.03-synthetic-ice-stream_27_0.png


We can see by plotting the mass balance that the system is much closer
to equilibrium than it was at the start.

.. code:: ipython3

    f = firedrake.interpolate(a - div(h * u), Q)
    fig, axes = icepack.plot.subplots()
    contours = icepack.plot.tricontourf(f, 25, cmap='RdBu', axes=axes)
    fig.colorbar(contours, label='meters/year', fraction=0.012, pad=0.04)
    plt.show(fig)



.. image:: icepack.demo.03-synthetic-ice-stream_files/icepack.demo.03-synthetic-ice-stream_29_0.png


Finally, we can draw some transects through the domain to see what the
surface, bed, and ice base elevation look like in the
:math:`x, z`-plane.

.. code:: ipython3

    import numpy as np
    xs = np.array([(Lx * k / nx, 0) for k in range(nx + 1)])
    
    ss = np.array(s.at(xs, tolerance=1e-10))
    hs = np.array(h.at(xs, tolerance=1e-10))
    bs = np.array(b.at(xs, tolerance=1e-10))
    
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.plot(xs[:, 0], bs, color='black')
    ax.plot(xs[:, 0], ss - hs, color='blue')
    ax.plot(xs[:, 0], ss, color='blue')
    plt.show(fig)



.. image:: icepack.demo.03-synthetic-ice-stream_files/icepack.demo.03-synthetic-ice-stream_31_0.png


The glacier exhibits the typical drop in thickness gradient as it
crosses the grounding line.

.. code:: ipython3

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.plot(xs[:, 0], hs)
    plt.show(fig)

Recap
~~~~~

The demonstration above shows how to simulate the evolution of a
grounded ice stream; while there are more fields to keep track of than
for a floating ice shelf, the basic principles are still the same.

Coming up with physically plausible synthetic test cases is difficult.
The variables that we can control are the bed geometry, the accumulation
rate, and the ice flux at inflow. To a certain extent, we can pick the
friction coefficient, but this can change in ways that are difficult to
predict as parts of the glacier begin to float. Our initial state was
far out of mass balance and we let it evolve towards equilibrium, but we
don’t know ahead of time what surface slope or stretching rate the
glacier will settle on in the end.

The eventual steady state could be physically implausible for reasons
that weren’t obvious from the start. For example, if the ice strain rate
increases beyond what we expect after a few years of model time, the
mass flux at the inflow boundary could be much larger than what the
influx and accumulation rate can supply, leading to an unphysically
sharp drop in the surface. Preparing this demonstration required lots of
trial and error to get the parameters just right, and that’s to be
expected.

The bed elevation we used sloped down towards the ocean; had we instead
used a bed elevation that sloped down going inland, the configuration
would be unstable due to marine ice sheet instability. An interesting
variation on this demo could be to use a bed geometry with several
stable pinning points, interspersed with unstable retrograde slopes.

Changing the model physics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the first part of this demo, we used the usual Weertman sliding law,
where the basal shear stress is proportional to some power of the ice
sliding speed. Weertman sliding assumes that the glacier slides by
regelation. Where the glacier flows over deformable sediments, the
sliding relation could instead approach plasticity – the stress depends
only on the direction and not the magnitude of the velocity. Other
sliding laws have been proposed that exhibit this feature, for example
the law proposed in Schoof (2005), The effect of cavitation on glacier
sliding.

In icepack, all of the diagnostic model physics is prescribed through an
action principle. Rather than specify how the shear stress depends on
the ice velocity, we specify the frictional energy dissipation. The
stress is then the functional derivative of the dissipation with respect
to velocity. For the Weertman sliding law

.. math:: \tau_b = -C|u|^{\frac{1}{m} - 1}u,

the energy dissipation is

.. math:: E(u) = \int \frac{m}{m + 1}C|u|^{\frac{1}{m} + 1}dx.

In the first part of the demo, we showed how to slightly modify the
physics by adding a thickness- and elevation-dependent factor to reduce
the friction when the glacier bed is below sea level. In the following,
we’ll show how to use a completely different model of glacier sliding.

The Schoof sliding law
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To modify the Weertman sliding law for high ice speeds, we need for the
energy dissipation density to be asymptotically like :math:`|u|^1` for
large :math:`u`, but like :math:`|u|^{1/m + 1}` for small :math:`u`.
“Small” and “large” will be defined relative to some reference speed
:math:`u_0`. While it doesn’t exactly reproduce the Schoof sliding law
itself, the following functional gives the right asymptotic behavior:

.. math:: E(u) = \int \tau_0\left(\left(u_0^{\frac{1}{m} + 1} + |u|^{\frac{1}{m} + 1}\right)^{\frac{m}{m + 1}} - u_0\right) dx

The extra factor of :math:`-u_0` is there to make it so that
:math:`E(0) = 0`, i.e. there is no dissipation when there is no flow.
The right value of :math:`u_0` isn’t very well constrained. For this
demonstration, we’ll use a value of 50 m/year, since this falls roughly
in the middle of the grounded region for the final velocity. We’ll then
choose the value of the factor :math:`\tau_0`, which has units of
stress, so that the stress is the same as the value at the end of the
simulation we’ve just run using Weertman sliding.

.. code:: ipython3

    u_threshold = 50
    U = sqrt(inner(u, u))
    τ_0 = firedrake.interpolate(C * (u_threshold**(1/m + 1) + U**(1/m + 1))**(1/(m + 1)), Q)

.. code:: ipython3

    fig, axes = icepack.plot.subplots()
    contours = icepack.plot.tricontourf(τ_0, 25, axes=axes)
    fig.colorbar(contours, label='MPa', fraction=0.012, pad=0.04)
    plt.show(fig)



.. image:: icepack.demo.03-synthetic-ice-stream_files/icepack.demo.03-synthetic-ice-stream_38_0.png


The following function returns the action functional associated to this
sliding law, given the ice velocity, elevation, and the yield stress.

.. code:: ipython3

    def schoof_friction(u, h, s, τ):
        ϕ = 1 - ρ_W/ρ_I * firedrake.max_value(0, h - s) / h
        U = sqrt(inner(u, u))
        return τ * ϕ * (u_threshold**(1/m + 1) + U**(1/m + 1))**(m/(m + 1)) * dx

We can then create a new ``IceStream`` object that will use this
function to calculate the action rather than the usual Weertman sliding
law:

.. code:: ipython3

    ice_stream_schoof = icepack.models.IceStream(friction=schoof_friction)

The Schoof friction functional that we defined above takes in more
parameters than the usual Weertman law, but thanks to keyword arguments
in Python, everything gets passed to the right place despite this
change. Let’s do a diagnostic solve with this new model and see how
different it is from the velocity obtained with the Weertman sliding
law.

.. code:: ipython3

    u_schoof = ice_stream_schoof.diagnostic_solve(u0=u, h=h, s=s, A=A, τ=τ_0, **opts)

.. code:: ipython3

    fig, axes = icepack.plot.subplots()
    contours = icepack.plot.tricontourf(u_schoof, 25, axes=axes)
    fig.colorbar(contours, label='meters/year', fraction=0.012, pad=0.04)
    plt.show(fig)



.. image:: icepack.demo.03-synthetic-ice-stream_files/icepack.demo.03-synthetic-ice-stream_45_0.png


.. code:: ipython3

    icepack.norm(u - u_schoof)




.. parsed-literal::

    2.2913137508180872e-10



Just as we expect – the resulting velocities are practically the same.
We picked the parameters in the Schoof sliding law to give the same
basal shear stress as with the Weertman law, so we should get the same
velocity.

Response to perturbations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The steady state we’ve found is roughly an equilibrium for both the
Weertman and Schoof sliding laws. To conclude this demo, we’ll increase
the melt rate under the floating ice tongue and see how the system
responds. To perturb the system out of its current equilibrium state,
we’ll add an extra 1 m/year of melting in the right-hand side of the
domain. If we wanted to be more physically realistic about things, we
might set the melt rate to be a function of depth below sea level, or
even use a plume model.

.. code:: ipython3

    a = 1.7 - 2.7 * x / Lx - firedrake.conditional(x/Lx > 0.5, 1.0, 0.0)

We’ll wrap up the same loop as we had before in a function that takes in
the model (Weertman or Schoof) as an argument. This saves a bit of
repetition and makes it easier to parallelize later.

.. code:: ipython3

    num_years = 100
    timesteps_per_year = 2
    
    δt = 1.0/timesteps_per_year
    num_timesteps = num_years * timesteps_per_year
    
    def run_simulation(model, h, s, u, **kwargs):
        for k in range(num_timesteps + 1):
            h = model.prognostic_solve(δt, h0=h, a=a, u=u, h_inflow=h0)
            s = model.compute_surface(h=h, b=b)
            u = model.diagnostic_solve(u0=u, h=h, s=s, **kwargs)
            print('.' if k * δt % 10 == 0 else '', end='')
            
        print('')
        return h, s, u
    
    h_weertman, s_weertman, u_weertman = run_simulation(
        model=ice_stream_weertman,
        h=h, s=s, u=u, A=A, C=C,
        **opts
    )
    
    h_schoof, s_schoof, u_schoof = run_simulation(
        model=ice_stream_schoof,
        h=h, s=s, u=u_schoof, A=A, τ=τ_0,
        **opts
    )


.. parsed-literal::

    ...........
    ...........


Finally, we’ll plot a transect of the difference in thickness between
the Weertman and Schoof laws. The glacier loses more mass over the
grounded region and less under the ice shelf with the Schoof law than
with the Weertman law. When the sliding relation becomes more plastic,
the bed can take up less of the increased driving stress resulting from
steeper surface slopes, so that changes under the ice shelf are evident
further upstream.

.. code:: ipython3

    hs_weertman = np.array(h_weertman.at(xs, tolerance=1e-10))
    hs_schoof = np.array(h_schoof.at(xs, tolerance=1e-10))
    
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.plot(xs[:, 0], hs_weertman - hs_schoof, color='black')
    plt.show(fig)

Conclusion
~~~~~~~~~~

The Schoof sliding law is, arguably, more physically realistic than the
Weertman sliding law for fast-flowing outlet glaciers or ice streams.
While icepack defaults to using the Weertman sliding law, replacing it
with the Schoof law consists of only a few lines of code. First, we have
to write a function that calculates the energy dissipation from
Schoof-type sliding. We then have to pass this function to the
constructor of the ``IceStream`` model object we use to calculate the
ice velocity. By passing in all the input fields to the
``diagnostic_solve`` method as keyword arguments, we don’t have to
rewrite or override any methods of ``IceStream``, despite the fact that
there are more input fields to the Schoof sliding law than there are for
the Weertman law.

In switching to the Schoof sliding law, we showed how the physics could
be modified to take in a possibly arbitrary number of different fields
beyond the default physics parameterization. These additional fields
could themselves be computed by solving other PDEs. For example, we
could define the basal shear stress to be a function of the effective
water pressure, which would then solve for using some model of
subglacial hydrology.
