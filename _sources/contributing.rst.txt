Icepack is free and open-source software.
The following pages are for you if you want to get involved with development.
We welcome contributions of new code in the form of pull requests.
Feature requests and bug reports can be made either through raising issues on the project page or via email.
See :doc:`testing <testing>` for more information about how we test the various numerical solvers in icepack.
:doc:`This page <design>` describes some of the internals of icepack and why things are written the way they are.
