The final key conserved quantity is thermal energy.
It's customary to use temperature as the main descriptive field, but in the following we're going to instead use the *energy density*.
Energy is transported just like any material quantity.
Usually energy is lost through the ice surface to the atmosphere.
The sources of energy are from ocean heating at the ice base and from strain heating within the ice column.
The full weak form for energy is

$$\begin{align}
\int_\Omega\int_b^s\left(\partial_tE\cdot\phi - Eu\cdot\nabla\phi + k\partial_zT\cdot\partial_z\phi - Q\phi\right)dz\,dx = 0
\end{align}$$
